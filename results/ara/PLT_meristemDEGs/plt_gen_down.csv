SNAREs have been divided into four subgroups: Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. R-SNAREs are classified into three groups, the Sec22-, YKT6- and VAMP7-like R-SNAREs. One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization.

UGT74F2 shows a weak ability to catalyze the formation of the p-aminobenzoate-glucose ester in vitro. But, UGT75B1 appears to be the dominant pABA acylglucosyltransferase in vivo based on assays in leaves, flowers, and siliques. The true biological substrate(s) of UGT74F2 are not known, but mutant plants lacking UGT74F2 have a decreased level of SAG and SGE.",-2.2,-0.94,-1.3,-0.88,-1,-2.4,0.02,-0.36,0.00173095376736152,0.00968607561950117,0.104263697342417,0.214799479474164,0.174916306479915,0.00102156252474858,0.998342219233687,0.423128318075709,-1,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0
