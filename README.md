# PLETHORA_network
This repository storages code, input data and some of the result derived from the research project "*Transcriptomic and network analysis for PLETHORA mediated gene regulation for RAM maintenance*".  The main goal of the project is to infer a gene regulatory network orchestrated by the PLT transcription factors, to characterize the topology of such network and to explore its relevance in the maintenance of the root apical meristem.

## Source data

We started from the raw RNA-Seq reads generated by [Huang & Schiefelbein](https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.15.00328) for *Arabidopsis thaliana* roots. We also used the information derived from [Santuari et al](https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.16.00656) and binding sites from the [PLANT PAN](http://plantpan.itps.ncku.edu.tw).
The SRA accession numbers used in this work were downloaded with the SRA-toolkit; a list of the SRA files used can be found in `source` > `SRR_Acc_List.txt`

Also, you can see more datailed metadata directly in the [RSA run selector](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA271595&o=acc_s%3Aa).

We used TAIR10 reference genome for mapping.
