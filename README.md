This repository will be the storage for code and data result derived from the research project "*Transcriptomic and network analysis for PLETHORA mediated gene regulation for RAM maintenance*".  
We started from RNA-Seq data provided by [Huang et al.](https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.15.00328) for *Arabidopsis thaliana, Cucumis sativus, Solanmun lycopersicum and Glycine max*.
