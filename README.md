# PLETHORA_network
This repository storages code, input data and some of the result derived from the research project "*Transcriptomic and network analysis for PLETHORA mediated gene regulation for RAM maintenance*".  The main goal of the project is to infer a gene regulatory network orchestrated by the PLT transcription factors, to characterize the topology of such network and to explore its relevance in the maintenance of the root apical meristem.

## Source data

We started from RNA-Seq data provided by [Huang & Schiefelbein](https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.15.00328) for *Arabidopsis thaliana* roots.  
You can find all the accession ids to download the reads with SRA-toolkit in the file `SRR_Acc_List.txt`in the `source` dir.

Also, you can see more datailed metadata directly in the [RSA run selector](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA271595&o=acc_s%3Aa).

We used TAIR10 reference genome for mapping.
