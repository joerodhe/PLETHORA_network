## Source data

We started from RNA-Seq data provided by [Huang & Schiefelbein](https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.15.00328) for *Arabidopsis thaliana, Cucumis sativus, Solanmun lycopersicum and Glycine max* roots.  
You can find all the accession ids for download the reads with SRA-toolkit in the file `SRR_Acc_List.txt`in the `source` dir.

Also, you can see more datailed metadata directly in the [RSA run selector](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA271595&o=acc_s%3Aa).

We used TAIR10 reference genome for mapping.
